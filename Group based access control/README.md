Group-Based Access Control (RBAC)
This section demonstrates how role-based access control (RBAC) was implemented using groups.
Instead of assigning permissions to individual users, access is managed through groups, allowing scalable and consistent identity management.

1. Creating a Role-Based Group
Added "Title and Department" attributes to newly created user profile. Title: Techinical Support Specialist Department: Engineering

Created a new group in Directory → Groups to represent the Enineering role within the organization.

Example configuration:

Group Name: GA Team
Description: Provides application access to GA employees.
Purpose:

Centralize permission management
Reduce manual user-level access assignments
Align access with organizational roles

2. Configuring Group Rules (Automated Membership)
Configured a Group Rule to automatically assign users to the group based on user profile attributes.

Example rule condition:

If Department = Engineering
Then assign user to Engineering-Team group.
(Insert screenshot here titled "Created Group Rule For Engineering")

Verification:

Newly created users with the Engineering department attribute were automatically added to the group.
IAM Insight:
Group rules automate identity governance by ensuring users receive access based on organizational attributes rather than manual assignments.

. Automating Application Provisioning
Assigned applications to the Engineering-Team group to automate access provisioning.

Provisioning workflow verified:

User account created
Group rule assigns user to Engineering-Team
Application access automatically provisioned through group membership
Benefits:

Consistent access control
Reduced administrative overhead
Faster onboarding for new users
IAM Insight:
Group-based provisioning supports scalable identity lifecycle management by linking user roles directly to application access.
